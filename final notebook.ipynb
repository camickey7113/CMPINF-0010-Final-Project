In order to choose our metric, we first considered what each of us believed to be what makes a neighborhood the best. Our team thinks that a good neighborhood is safe, has a nice appearance, and provides a good experience for a family to live in.\n",

We considered metrics such as the most beautiful neighborhood, the best for a family, and the safest neighborhood. However, after searching through the data sets provided on the data center, we were unable to find data specific enough to support many of the metrics we brainstormed.\n",
